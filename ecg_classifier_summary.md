# ECG Classifier Project Summary

## Achievements

1. **Created a robust ECG classifier for real data**:
   - Built a feature extraction pipeline for 140-point ECG data
   - Achieved 97.3% accuracy on test data
   - Excellent sensitivity (98.5%) and specificity (95.7%)

2. **Evaluated multiple machine learning approaches**:
   - Tested Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Neural Network, and K-Nearest Neighbors
   - Compared performance across multiple metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC AUC)
   - All models performed well, with Gradient Boosting and Neural Network achieving the highest accuracy (97.5%)

3. **Implemented advanced analysis tools**:
   - Created misclassification analysis to identify patterns in errors
   - Used t-SNE visualization to understand feature distributions
   - Generated specific improvement suggestions for reducing false positives and false negatives

4. **Identified key features for classification**:
   - Maximum amplitude and signal range were most important
   - Wavelet energy features provided valuable multi-scale analysis
   - R-peak detection and heart rate variability metrics improved discrimination

5. **Documented the entire process**:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with version 0.2.0 entries
   - Created comprehensive README with performance metrics and usage instructions
   - Committed all code to the repository for future reference

## Practical Uses

The created scripts can be used to:
- Train new models on similar ECG data
- Evaluate model performance and compare different approaches
- Test the classifier on individual ECG samples
- Analyze misclassifications to improve the model further

The high accuracy (97.3%) makes this classifier suitable for practical applications in ECG screening and preliminary diagnosis, potentially helping to identify abnormal heart patterns that require further medical attention.
