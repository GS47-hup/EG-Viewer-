# Machine Learning Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our plan to integrate a pre-trained machine learning model from the [ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier](https://github.com/Tobai24/ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier) repository into our ECG Viewer application. This integration will enhance our classification capabilities, allowing for more accurate and comprehensive arrhythmia detection.

## Current Status
- We have implemented a basic rule-based ECG classifier
- Our evaluation tool (`evaluate_current_classifier.py`) provides a framework for assessing classifier performance
- We are now ready to enhance our classification with a machine learning approach

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Exploration and Setup
1. **Clone the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier repo**
   - Examine model architecture and dependencies
   - Identify the pre-trained model file (`model.pkl`)
   - Review data preprocessing requirements

2. **Dependencies Analysis**
   - Compare required libraries with our current dependencies
   - Create a list of additional dependencies to install
   - Test model loading and basic inference

3. **Create a Test Environment**
   - Set up a virtual environment for testing
   - Install required dependencies
   - Test model functionality in isolation

### Phase 2: Model Integration
1. **Create ECG ML Classifier Module**
   - Implement `ml_ecg_classifier.py` module
   - Create an interface that matches our current classifier
   - Add preprocessing functions to transform ECG data for model input

2. **Model Loading and Inference**
   - Implement functions to load the pre-trained model
   - Create inference methods for ECG classification
   - Map model outputs to cardiac conditions

3. **Error Handling and Fallback**
   - Implement error handling for model loading
   - Create a fallback mechanism to use our rule-based classifier
   - Add logging for errors and performance issues

### Phase 3: UI Integration
1. **Modify the ECG Simulator UI**
   - Add option to choose between rule-based and ML-based classification
   - Create settings panel for ML model configuration
   - Add visual indicators for ML-based classification

2. **Classification Visualization**
   - Enhance classification results display
   - Add confidence scores visualization
   - Implement feature importance visualization

3. **Results Comparison**
   - Add functionality to compare rule-based and ML classifications
   - Visualize differences in classification results
   - Provide explanations for classification decisions

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Optimization
1. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Adapt the evaluation script to assess ML classifier performance
   - Compare ML vs. rule-based classifier metrics
   - Generate comprehensive performance reports

2. **Optimization**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize preprocessing for speed
   - Implement caching for frequent operations

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the ML integration
   - Create user guides for the ML classification features
   - Update technical documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Model Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Joblib (for model loading)

### Integration Requirements
- Consistent interface with current classifier
- Preprocessing functions to match model input requirements
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Performance monitoring and logging

### UI Requirements
- Toggle between rule-based and ML classification
- Settings panel for ML configuration
- Visual indicators for ML-based results

## Success Metrics
- Improvement in classification accuracy by at least 15%
- Reduction in false positives by at least 20%
- Support for at least 5 additional arrhythmia types
- Classification time under 500ms per ECG sample
- Seamless user experience with no UI freezing

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Exploration): 1 week
- Phase 2 (Model Integration): 2 weeks
- Phase 3 (UI Integration): 1 week
- Phase 4 (Evaluation and Optimization): 1 week

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Model compatibility issues | High | Medium | Test early, prepare model conversion scripts |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Optimize preprocessing, implement caching |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Use virtual environments, containerization |
| Accuracy not improved | High | Low | Prepare fallback to rule-based, consider ensemble |
| UI responsiveness issues | Medium | Medium | Run ML inference in separate thread |

## Next Steps
1. Clone the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier repository
2. Examine the model and dependencies
3. Create a proof of concept for model loading and inference
4. Begin implementation of the `ml_ecg_classifier.py` module
