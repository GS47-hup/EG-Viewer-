For False Positives (Normal classified as Abnormal):
  - Adjust thresholds for 'wavelet_energy_5' feature
  - Adjust thresholds for 'mean' feature
  - Adjust thresholds for 'max' feature
For False Negatives (Abnormal classified as Normal):
  - Adjust thresholds for 'st_elevation' feature
  - Adjust thresholds for 'mean' feature
  - Adjust thresholds for 'wavelet_energy_4' feature

General Improvement Suggestions:
  - Collect more data for underrepresented classes
  - Try additional feature engineering focused on the problematic features
  - Consider ensemble methods combining multiple classifiers
  - Experiment with class weights to balance false positives and false negatives
