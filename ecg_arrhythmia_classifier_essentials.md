# ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier: Essential Information

## What It Does
- This is a tool that can analyze ECG signals and detect different types of heart irregularities (arrhythmias)
- It uses machine learning to classify ECG readings into 5 categories:
  - Normal beats
  - Supraventricular ectopic beats
  - Ventricular ectopic beats
  - Fusion beats
  - Unknown beats

## Model Performance
- The model achieves excellent performance:
  - Accuracy: 98.83% (on test data)
  - ROC AUC Score: 0.9910 (a measure of how well the model can distinguish between classes)
- This means it correctly identifies the type of heartbeat about 99% of the time
- The high ROC AUC Score indicates that the model is very good at distinguishing between normal and abnormal heartbeats

## Key Components You Should Know About

### The Model
- The repository contains a pre-trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`)
- This model was trained on medical ECG datasets
- You don't need to train it yourself - it's ready to use

### Two Ways to Use It
1. **Web App** (easiest option):
   - The repository includes a Streamlit web interface
   - This gives you a user-friendly way to input ECG data and get predictions
   - There's even a live version at https://heart-class.streamlit.app/

2. **Local API**:
   - For more technical users, there's a Flask API
   - This lets you send ECG data and receive predictions programmatically

## How It Could Integrate With Your ECG-Viewer
- This could be added as an optional "AI-powered" classifier in your ECG-Viewer
- Users could choose between your existing rule-based classifier or this ML classifier
- The ML classifier might detect patterns that rule-based systems miss

## To Use It, You Need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries listed in requirements.txt
- Basic understanding of running Python scripts

## Getting Started (Simplest Path)
1. Install Python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. If you want to use the web interface locally:
   - Navigate to the `deployment/web_deployment` folder
   - Run: `streamlit run app.py`
   - This will open a web interface where you can input ECG parameters

## What You DON'T Need to Worry About
- You don't need to understand the model's inner workings
- You don't need to retrain the model
- You don't need to set up the monitoring system unless you want to track model performance

## Folder Explanation
- `/deployment/web_deployment`: Contains the web interface (what you'll likely use)
- `/deployment/local_deployment`: Contains the API option
- `/data`: Contains the datasets used to train the model (you don't need to use these)
- `/notebooks`: Technical files for model training (you can ignore these)
- `/monitoring`: Advanced tools for tracking model performance (optional)
