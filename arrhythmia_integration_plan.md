# ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier Integration Plan

This document outlines the steps to integrate the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier into our ECG-Viewer application.

## Goals

1. Integrate the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier while maintaining compatibility with our existing systems
2. Leverage its arrhythmia detection capabilities to improve our classification accuracy
3. Create a unified classifier that combines the strengths of both approaches
4. Ensure proper evaluation and comparison with our current classifiers

## Steps

### 1. Clone and Analyze the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tobai24/ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier.git
```

- Analyze the code structure and dependencies
- Identify the key classification algorithms and approaches
- Understand the data format it expects
- Review the performance metrics

### 2. Create Integration Adapter

- Develop adapter code to connect our ECG data format with the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier
- Create utilities to convert between different data formats
- Implement wrapper classes to standardize the interface

### 3. Combine Classification Approaches

- Identify complementary strengths between our ML classifier and the Arrhythmia-Classifier
- Develop an ensemble approach that leverages both systems
- Create voting or weighting mechanisms for final classifications

### 4. Evaluation Framework

- Develop a comprehensive evaluation script
- Test on our existing labeled ECG datasets
- Compare performance against our current rule-based and ML classifiers
- Generate detailed metrics and visualizations to assess improvements

### 5. UI Integration

- Update our ECG-Viewer UI to incorporate the new classification capabilities
- Add appropriate visualizations for arrhythmia detection
- Ensure real-time performance for interactive use

## Timeline

1. Initial analysis and setup: 2-3 days
2. Adapter development: 3-5 days
3. Ensemble classifier implementation: 4-7 days
4. Testing and evaluation: 3-4 days
5. UI integration: 2-3 days

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Incompatible data formats
  - **Mitigation**: Develop robust conversion utilities with extensive testing

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with combined approach
  - **Mitigation**: Implement A/B testing and feature toggles to revert if needed

- **Risk**: Dependencies conflicts
  - **Mitigation**: Use virtual environments and careful dependency management

## Evaluation Criteria

Success will be measured by:
1. Improved classification accuracy (target: +5% or more)
2. Maintained or improved processing speed
3. Successful detection of complex arrhythmias
4. Positive user feedback on new classification capabilities
