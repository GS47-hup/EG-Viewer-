# ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier Integration Plan

This document outlines the steps to add the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier to our ECG-Viewer application as a separate, standalone classifier.

## Goals

1. Add the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier as a completely separate classifier option
2. Maintain clear separation from our existing classification approaches
3. Provide a way to switch between different classifiers in the UI
4. Evaluate and compare performance independently 

## Steps

### 1. Clone and Analyze the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tobai24/ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier.git
```

- Analyze the code structure and dependencies
- Identify the key classification algorithms and approaches
- Understand the data format it expects
- Review the performance metrics

### 2. Create Standalone Adapter

- Develop adapter code to connect our ECG data format with the ECG-Arrhythmia-Classifier
- Create utilities to convert between different data formats
- Keep all code in a separate module structure

### 3. Independent Implementation

- Implement the arrhythmia classifier as a completely separate option
- Avoid any mixing of classifier logic with existing ML or rule-based systems
- Create clear boundaries between the different classifiers

### 4. Separate Evaluation Framework

- Develop a dedicated evaluation script for the arrhythmia classifier
- Test on our existing labeled ECG datasets
- Compare performance against our other classifiers but maintain separation
- Generate detailed metrics and visualizations specific to this classifier

### 5. UI Integration with Selector

- Update our ECG-Viewer UI to allow switching between classifier options
- Add a classifier selection dropdown/toggle
- Create dedicated visualizations for arrhythmia detection when that classifier is selected
- Ensure clear indication of which classifier is currently active

## Timeline

1. Initial analysis and setup: 2-3 days
2. Standalone adapter development: 3-5 days 
3. Independent implementation: 4-7 days
4. Testing and evaluation: 3-4 days
5. UI integration with selector: 2-3 days

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Incompatible data formats
  - **Mitigation**: Develop robust conversion utilities with extensive testing

- **Risk**: Confusion between classifier outputs
  - **Mitigation**: Clear UI indicators showing which classifier is active

- **Risk**: Dependencies conflicts
  - **Mitigation**: Use virtual environments and careful dependency management

## Evaluation Criteria

Success will be measured by:
1. Successful addition of the arrhythmia classifier as a separate option
2. Complete independence from existing classifiers
3. Ability to switch seamlessly between classifier types
4. Comprehensive performance metrics for each classifier
